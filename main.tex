\begin{abstract}
The present study aims to support decision-making at individual level and at the level of political decision-makers at the level of housing in Portugal. At the individual level, it intends aid in the purchase/investment decision, either of the buyer, as well as the investor.
At the level of political decision makers, whether they are municipal, inter-municipal or national, it intends to be an aid in decision-making on the best policies for the promotion, renewal and rehabilitation of housing in their intervention areas.
In this work data available in PORDATA -- Portugal Contemporary Database of all 308 municipalities in Portugal were used. The methodology adopted consists in a multiple linear regression, in order to understand which factors most influence the average value of the dwellings traded by municipality. Subsequently, an analysis was carried out in order to identify possible clusters within the municipalities.
Factors considered include variables related to location of municipalities, population density of the municipalities, purchasing power of the inhabitants of the municipalities, average size of families in the municipalities, unemployment in municipalities, environmental quality in municipalities, aging in municipalities, average level of education in municipalities, civil status of the inhabitants of the municipalities, own housing by the owner in the municipalities, existing housing in municipalities. 
The results suggest that only population density and environmental quality have no significant influence on the average value per municipality of transacted housing. 2, 3 or 4 clusters of municipalities can be considered, always highlighting a group of municipalities with a much higher housing price than the others.

\section{INTRODUCTION}

Housing is not only a fundamental human right but also a critical component of a stable and thriving society. The provision of safe, affordable, and stable housing forms the bedrock upon which individuals and families build their lives. The significance of housing was brought into sharp relief following the 2007 financial crisis, an event that precipitated a seismic shift in the global economic landscape. The crisis exposed vulnerabilities in the financial system, resulting in stringent credit conditions and a liquidity shortfall. These financial disturbances had a domino effect, causing widespread economic turmoil. The availability of housing finance became constrained, leading to a decline in homeownership and a spike in foreclosures. The aftershocks of this economic upheaval were felt across various sectors, underscoring the intricate link between housing markets and financial stability. As we navigate the post-crisis world, the lessons learned continue to shape policies and frameworks aimed at ensuring that the right to housing is safeguarded against such systemic shocks in the future.

The evolution of society has brought with it a heightened awareness of what constitutes essential human needs, among which housing stands out as a critical factor. As a result, there is a growing demand for housing that not only provides shelter but also meets a range of specific requirements that align with contemporary living standards and personal aspirations. These requirements often encompass considerations such as location, accessibility, environmental sustainability, and technological integration.
This evolving demand compels a closer examination of the diverse factors that drive individual and collective choices in the housing market. Factors such as demographic changes, economic conditions, cultural trends, and policy developments all play a part in shaping housing preferences and, by extension, the real estate landscape. For example, a societal shift towards remote work may increase the desire for homes with office spaces, while urbanization trends might heighten the value placed on proximity to amenities and transportation.
Understanding these factors is not only academically interesting but also practically vital for stakeholders, including policymakers, urban planners, real estate developers, and financial institutions. Insights into housing preferences can inform strategies to address housing shortages, guide the development of new housing projects, influence zoning laws, and inform mortgage lending criteria.
Moreover, these preferences have a direct correlation with the average value of housing. When certain features become highly sought after, properties that possess these attributes may see an increase in value, potentially altering the market dynamics. Conversely, houses lacking these desired characteristics may experience a decrease in perceived value, impacting affordability and availability.
In essence, the intersection of human needs and housing choices is a dynamic area of study that has far-reaching implications for individuals, communities, and the broader economy. It is a subject that requires continuous research to ensure that the housing market can adapt and respond to the changing tapestry of societal needs.

The primary goal of this study is to determine the factors that influence the value of housing in municipalities in Portugal. This is an econometric study aimed at assessing the impact of various characteristics of the municipalities on the average value of housing transactions carried out in these municipalities. It also seeks to understand how the variation of these municipal characteristics influences the evolution of prices. Additionally, the objectives of this work include studying the behavior of housing value fluctuations in Portugal and determining the similarities between municipalities regarding these fluctuations.

Existing research on the determinants of housing values has largely concentrated on broad geographic scopes, such as international comparisons, regional trends, or areas surrounding major urban centers. There has been a notable lack of in-depth analysis at finer scales like that of municipalities. This gap in the literature is what the current study seeks to address. It endeavors to carry out a detailed national-level analysis, with a focus on the individual municipalities within Portugal. The objective is to categorize these municipalities based on the Average Market Value of Property Transactions (VMPT) and to pinpoint the specific factors that exert an influence on these values. By doing so, the study aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the local variables affecting housing prices within the distinct Portuguese municipalities.

This research offers significant insights and applications that inform decision-making processes for a range of stakeholders. On the individual level, it equips buyers and investors with data-driven guidance, facilitating more informed and strategic market engagements. At the collective level, it serves as a resource for policymakers, providing an empirical foundation for the development of housing policies. Consequently, this study not only enriches the theoretical discourse in academic circles but also stands as a practical tool for real-world application in the housing sector.

\subsection{\uppercase{Conclusions}}

The results suggest that only population density and environmental quality have no significant influence on the average value per municipality of transacted housing. 2, 3 or 4 clusters of municipalities can be considered, always highlighting a group of municipalities with a much higher housing price than the others.

When 2 clusters are considered, cluster 1 is made up of municipalities with below-average population density, while cluster 2 is made up of municipalities with higher population density.

Cluster 2 consists of all municipalities in the Metropolitan area of Porto and Lisbon and most of the district capitals. 
Cluster 1 is made up of 261 municipalities and appears to correspond to the poorest and least populous municipalities, while cluster 2 It is made up of 47 municipalities, demonstrating a great disparity between them, appearing to correspond to the richest and most populous municipalities.

3 or 4 clusters can also be considered, always highlighting a group of municipalities with a much higher VMHT than the others.
